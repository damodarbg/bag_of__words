# bag_of__words

I used thge kaggel data set

If u see first I have uploaded the data and check the shape of it.

Later proceeded with stemming process.



Once the data is cleaned stored all the reviews at a place using a function.

Created bag of words using count vectorizer then trained the classifer using fit_transform() method followed by converting classifier into array.
Now trained the data with different alogorithms.
1) RandomForest
2) NavieBayes
3) AdaBoost

Now the data is trained with different algorithms.

Right away uploaded test data followed by cleaning and parsing.

and then predicted sentiments for all three models.
